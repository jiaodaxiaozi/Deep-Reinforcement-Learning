# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
Various Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques applied to different environments. Will be updated with new algorithms and environments often!


Just added (09/01/2018) is a Deep Q-learning (dqn) implementation applied to the Atari game: breakout! 

## Requirements

* python 3.6
* keras
* tensorflow
* gym
* numpy
* opencv
* random
* collections


## Getting Started

Running this code is very simple. Make sure that you have the above requirements taken care of, then download the two python files. In the command line, or any python editor change directory to where these two files are located and type:

```python
python dqn.py
```

This code makes use of an atari wrapper code that can be found [here](https://github.com/openai/baselines/blob/master/baselines/common/atari_wrappers.py)

Priortized experience replay version of this code, as well as, a Double DQN (DDQN) version will be uploaded shortly!
